# APIs

## [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)

A service that provides authentication which allows users to securely register and login using multiple identity providers. Analytics are also provided by Auth0. Pawsnfind uses AuthO for registration with either email or google and to login into both rescue and user accounts.

## [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ca/connect)

Provides a way to securely accept payments. Pawsnfind uses a feature in the Stripe API called connect. It allows Pawsnfind as a platform to transfer donations directly from adopters to rescue organizations.

## [Propublica](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/api)

Propublica Nonprofit Explorer API provides a way to verify EIN numbers are valid and non profit organizations. Pawsnfind uses it in the rescue on boarding process to validate the EIN number entered by the organization rep.

## [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/solutions/email-api/)

SendGrid API allows Pawsnfind to receive emails from the contact us form and to send a notification to the rescue organization when an application is received.

# NPM Modules

## [Zipcodes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zipcodes)

This module allows Pawsnfind to conduct a radius search for a zip code that is input by a visitor. 

## [React Responsive Carousel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive-carousel)

This displays pictures of animals in a responsive carousel.
